# dzbass

  Hi. I'm student of Electrical & Computer Engineering from Serbia. 
  My name is Dusan, and I'm also and bassist for many local bands.
  When I say local I mean Cacak's. That's my hometown.
  
  I'm lil bit older than most of my classmates because... I've already
  finished one college. It was Graphic Engineering but I did't like it.
